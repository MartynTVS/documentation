# Getting started

There are three stages to go through to get started with ACS Onboarding, and they're described in the sections below:

## Agents and configuration

At least one agent has to be deployed to a on-premise server in order to use the onboarding features. Don't worry though, it's really easy to setup and configure. The instructions are covered in this [section](deploying-agent.md).

## Creating a workflow

After the agent is properly configured the next step is to create a workflow. The instructions are covered in this [section](creating-a-workflow.md).

## Mapping the first user

The final step in using Onboarding is to map a test (or pilot) user. The instructions are covered in this [section](mapping.md).
