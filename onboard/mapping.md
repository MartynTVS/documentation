# Mapping

The process of assigning a workflow to a user is called mapping. This step can be done on individual users, or hundreds of users! Lets see how to perform a mapping of one test user in the following section.

This process takes place on the Mappings tab in the user interface.

## Finding a user

The mappings page shows a list of your on-premises users. You can use the search box to quickly locate the user you wish to process.  Once you've located the user. Select the checkbox next to that user, and click on the 'Map' button above the data grid.

**Note**: You can not map an already mapped user.

## Mapping the user

The process of mapping a user is simple. You can give this chosen batch a name - that's useful for tracking purposes. You pick a workflow template, and a priority and you can even add a comment for the batch which will help later if someone has questions around the users in the batch.

## What happens now?

The mappings page will reflect the selections and mapping you have created. In the background our onboarding application will perform all the necessary steps in your chosen workflow, and the user interface on the mapping and batches page will be updated to show the current status.


# Batching

Processing one user as we've done here is useful if you want to test the process of onboarding with your chosen workflow. Once the testing is done you will want to begin processing your user population in batches. That's covered in this [section](batching.md).
