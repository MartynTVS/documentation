# Batching

Batching is an important step in onboarding lots of users. We've added the ability to the Onboarding application to setup batches manually, as well as being able to pick, use and customize automatically created batches based on groups.

All of this takes place on the Batches tab in the application, and is described below.

## List of batches

The top of the batches tab shows you batches that have already been created. Here you can perform operations on those batches such as enabling or disabling them from migration. You can also see the priority of the batch, how many users are in the batch,  whether the batch has already finished onboarding and much more!

## Selecting a batch

If a batch is selected in the top data table, then the bottom of the screen shows more details about users which are in that batch including the workflow that they are assigned and the status.

## Groups lead to batches

We've added some predefined templates to help with creating batches. These are based on Active Directory properties. Groups can also be created manually. We've made it super flexible to even pick some people from a particular group and create a batch of just those users!
