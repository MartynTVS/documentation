# Signing - up

When you visit our portal one of two things will happen:

1. If you are already signed into the Office 365 portal, you will go straight past our landing page to our subscription page

2. If you're not signed into the Office 365 portal you will need to sign in, and then you will go to our subscription page

**Note:** If you have never signed into the portal before, Office 365 will provide a page which gives the ability to read parts of your Office 365 profile.

If you're an existing customer, and you reach our portal page, you can also sign in using the **'Sign in'** link at the top right of your portal window.

## Subscription page

This page shows you any active application subscriptions, and you can create a new subscription if you need to.  If you don't see a subscription
like the one shown below, you are not yet setup and should create a subscription as described in the next section.

## Creating a new subscription

If you need to create a subscription you can do so on this page. You will be shown our terms and conditions and after agreeing to those
your cloudficient application tenant will be created. This usually takes a few seconds, and you'll be returned back to the subscription
page afterwards.

## Launching the application
Once the subscription has been created you can click on the link near the top of the page, to launch the application.
