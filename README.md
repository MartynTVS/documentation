# Documentation
We use DocFX for our help and documentation side of things.

## [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/)
You can download the zip package of the precompiled binaries if you would like to play from [here](https://github.com/dotnet/docfx/releases).

To build the project, call the DocFX binary and point it to the repository ```docfx.json``` file and use the parameter ```--serve``` to spawn a web-service that listens on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) E.G.

```
c:\docfx\docfx.exe c:\docs\docfx.json --serve
```
