# Getting started

After configuration during the getting started wizard where this application was set-up, we can begin capturing audit events from Microsoft. 
In actual fact the process is that we subscribe to notifications about events, Microsoft notifies us when data is available, and we fetch it. 
This data is then stored securely in our system and made available for you to perform queries against to discover valuable information relating to usage and operations being performed in your Office 365 tenant.

For further information on using the auditing module, review the menu on the left.
