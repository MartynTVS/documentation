These responsive charts display useful information about part of your Offiec 365 experience, 
and in many cases you can hover over a segment of the chart to see clearer details about. On some charts, like the one
below you, you can click on a segment to zoom-in on the activity:

![chart2](../images/email-activity1.png "Overall Email activity")

... and when you click on the segment relating to 'sent' activities the chart changes to this:

![chart3](../images/email-activity2.png "Sent Email activity")
