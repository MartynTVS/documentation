# Example data

Whenever possible inside the application we like to provide data to reinforce and support the chart data. As
an example, here is some tabular data 

![table1](../images/tabular-data.png "OneDrive Usage Table Data")

These tables help reinforce the message which the accompanying chart shows. In addition, there
are several other features available with the data tables:

- Copy the data to the clipboard
- Eexport the data in PDF or CSV format
- Change the number of results returned (to make the table longer or shorter)
- Page through the results
- Search the results
- Sort the results, by clicking on a column heading
