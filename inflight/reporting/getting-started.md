# Getting started

We have made it super-easy to navigate within our product. The information to help you make better decisions relating to your Office 365 tenant, is just a click away!

As a reminder, we need to go through a process called **consent** in order to be able to collect reporting and auditing data from your tenant. You can find out more about that [here](data-collection.md).

In the menu on the left are general examples of what we include in most of our reports, as well as some specific use cases.

## Getting Started Wizard

When you have created a new subscription, you can enter the application and run through the Getting Started Wizard.

It starts with this screen:

![Setup Wizard](../images/gsw/gsw1.png "Setup Wizard")

The advanced Office 365 reporting application has to have permission from one of your Office 365 Global Administrators in order to be able to collect data from Microsoft about your tenant. 
So the first question which is asked is whether you are a Global Administrator:

![Setup Wizard](../images/gsw/gsw2.png "Global Administrator?")

If you are a Global Administrator of your Office 365 tenant, click on 'Yes' and you can continue. If you aren't, you will see this:

![Setup Wizard](../images/gsw/gsw3.png "Enter email address")

They will get an email asking them to complete the 'application consent'.

If you are the global admin, or your global admin gets the email and starts the wizard, they will see this:

![Setup Wizard](../images/gsw/gsw4.png "CF consent info")

When you click on consent you are redirected to the Microsoft Office 365 portal. If you're session is still valid you will get this:

![Setup Wizard](../images/gsw/gsw5.png "O365 consent")

**Note:** If your session isn't valid, you'll need to login to your subscription, before the above will appear.

There are a few more steps in the wizard: info about our upcoming on-premises agent, and the ability to enter some additional O365 credentials for us to run PowerShell scripts (to collect even more data)â€¦ and eventually you'll get the following.

## What's next?

Once you get to the end you will be inside the application itself. In the background the process to collect data about your Office 365 usage will have already begun.
Usually within a few minutes data will start to appear on the charts and data tables inside the application.
